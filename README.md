VolumeManager
=============

A Cocoa-style interface for DiskArbitration-style functionality (and more)

VolumeManager exists to make working with disks, mounts, and more that
much easier. It is pure Objective-C (no C), uses delegates and protocols
instead of C-style callbacks, and wraps in a few extra niceities just
because.

Think of it as Disk Utility in Objective-C.
